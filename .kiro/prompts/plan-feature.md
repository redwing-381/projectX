# Plan a new feature

## Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Mission

Transform a feature request into a **comprehensive implementation plan** through systematic codebase analysis and strategic planning.

**Core Principle**: We do NOT write code in this phase. Our goal is to create a context-rich implementation plan.

## Planning Process

### Phase 1: Feature Understanding

**Deep Feature Analysis:**
- Extract the core problem being solved
- Identify user value and impact
- Determine feature type: New Capability/Enhancement/Refactor/Bug Fix
- Assess complexity: Low/Medium/High

**Create User Story:**
```
As a <type of user>
I want to <action/goal>
So that <benefit/value>
```

### Phase 2: Codebase Analysis

**1. Project Structure Analysis**
- Map directory structure and patterns
- Identify service/component boundaries
- Locate configuration files

**2. Pattern Recognition**
- Search for similar implementations
- Identify coding conventions
- Document patterns to follow

**3. Integration Points**
- Identify existing files that need updates
- Determine new files to create
- Map API/route patterns

### Phase 3: Plan Generation

**Create plan with:**
- Feature description and user story
- Files to create/modify
- Step-by-step tasks
- Testing strategy
- Validation commands

## Output Format

**Filename**: `.kiro/plans/{kebab-case-name}.md`

Create comprehensive plan following the template structure.
